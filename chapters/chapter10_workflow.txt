
**Chapter Ten:**

## Point of view character: Petty Officer Joanne Washington

**characters:** Jo Washington, John Rumbly (unconscious), Navy enlisted sailors Evers, Moon, and Smith 

This chapter has three main elements:

1. Jo Washington discovers the young man with severe burns near the land north of the bridge ramp. She makes sure the burn victim gets treatment, then continues her scouting.
2. While scouting, she is able to identify the plants from a survival training background.
3. She discovers tracks of a person heading towards their direction. She begins to understand that the burn victim came from the forest.

The Hitchcock suspense principal comes into play. The reader knows more than the character. There are two elements that the reader already knows. First, the young man is John Rumbly, the late 15th century 14 year old from Macclesfield who was trespassing in the King's Forest. Washington 's survival training is giving her the clues that seem impossible

## Rough draft

Jo Washington examined the portable radio unit, a relic from a bygone era.  Bulky and awkward, it lacked a proper pouch, but the shipyard rigger's makeshift clip would have to do. Its weight thumped against her thigh with each step, an annoying counterpoint to the impossible task ahead. 

Commander Middleton had assigned her team to scout the Northwest quadrant, the river marking the dividing line. They were four: Washington, Evers, Moon, and Smith.  They'd started at the shipyard, tracking the Riverside until they reached the bridge ramp.  The bridge, a familiar landmark, now ended abruptly where the river vanished into the hard line that cleaved their world in two.

Just beyond, a gravel lot bordered a fenced-off construction site – a playground, she realized, only a fragment remaining.  Smoldering patches sent up wisps of smoke. Washington nodded to Moon, who hefted the shovel.  He stepped up into the forested area, boots sinking into the loose soil.  Belle Rive, it seemed, lay a full foot and a half lower than the city that loomed on the other side of the divide.

The unnatural boundary gleamed dully.  The flash of whatever cataclysm had caused this had baked the earth into something akin to glass.  Moon doused the embers with rhythmic sweeps of his shovel. 

Washington surveyed the woodland, the rifle loaned by Fischer a reassuring weight against her shoulder. This wasn't a training exercise, no neatly defined mission parameters.  This was the yawning unknown.

"Washington, got a body over here!" Evers' shout sliced through her thoughts.

She found him kneeling by a figure sprawled close to the boundary, near the bridge ramp's support wall.  The man wore rough-spun clothes, undyed and faded. Evers, practicality winning out, had swapped his dress whites for salvaged civilian gear.

"Dead?" she asked, setting the Dakota 76 against the wall of the bridge ramp. No time for fancy gear — this was hands-on, the kind of crisis that demanded action, not just observation.

Evers peered more closely, his touch hesitant. "Breathing's shallow.  Poor bastard must've been real close to the edge. Look at these burns."

Washington circled for a better view, her stomach clenching.

"Jesus," she breathed. "It's just a kid. He needs the doc, I'll call it in," she told Evers, fingers fumbling slightly with the unfamiliar radio controls.

"Washington to command, come in, over."

Static hissed, punctuated by distant voices, garbled and useless. Then Frost's voice sliced through, sharp as a command across a parade ground. "Frost here, Washington. Report."

"Sir, we've got a civilian casualty near the boundary, Belle Rive side of the river, north of the bridge.  Male, maybe fifteen, severe burns, unconscious.  Need medical evac, ASAP, over."  No time for pleasantries, not with the boy gasping ragged breaths at her feet.

A brief pause, then Frost's voice again, tinged with strain but still holding that steely edge. "Acknowledged, Washington.  Sending team now.  Hold your position, over."

"Roger that, sir. Washington out."  She snapped the radio off.

Washington's gaze swept the area, seeking something, anything, that might offer a clue about how he'd ended up here. Her boot nudged a length of wood lying in the burnt grass.  She squatted, turning it over. It was a bow staff, the string scorched away, leaving only remnants at either end.

"What do you make of this?" she asked Evers, holding it up. He eyed the crude weapon, then glanced back at the boy.

"Out hunting?"  His voice held a hint of skepticism.

Washington snorted.  "In the middle of a city, dressed like that?"

Evers shrugged.  "Kids are strange these days."

"Kids have always been strange," Washington countered.

The rumble of an engine cut through the tense silence, and the fire chief's truck barreled into view, kicking up dust from the familiar road to the bridge. Two firefighters and a sailor spilled out, the sailor's dress whites a jarring contrast to the scorched earth.

A wave of relief washed over her – they weren't alone. Yet, a nagging worry surfaced: were they stretching resources too thin, robbing someone else in greater need? The boy's ragged breaths pushed those doubts aside.  For now, he was their crisis, their responsibility.

One firefighter carried a bulky paramedic's bag. The sailor and the other firefighter hefted a stretcher, moving with practiced ease despite the rough ground. Washington's focus narrowed; the immediate, tangible task was her only anchor in this chaos.

Washington kneeled beside the boy as the firefighter with the bulky bag snapped it open. No pristine hospital ward here – just dust, sweat, and the pungent smell of scorched earth. 

"Pulse is weak, breathing shallow," the firefighter reported, fingers probing the boy's neck. His brow furrowed as he peeled back the burned fabric. "Bad burns, second degree at least. Pupils…"  He fumbled for a penlight, the tiny beam harsh against the boy's unresponsive eyes. "Non-reactive."

The sailor helped lift the boy onto the stretcher, a grunt escaping him as they shifted the dead weight. Washington felt a pang of guilt at the sight – he wasn't much older than her own kid brother back home, swallowed up by this inexplicable chaos.

"We gotta move," the other firefighter's voice cut through her thoughts. "He needs a proper hospital, not this," he gestured helplessly at their makeshift triage site.

A flicker of hope sparked in Washington. "Smith!" she called to the remaining member of her scout team. "Wasn't there talk of getting the Alliance medical bay up and running?"

Smith hurried over. "Yeah, I think so. Last I heard, they got the engines going, at least partially." 

A surge of adrenaline coursed through Washington. Six hours – a mere sliver of time – yet it felt like they'd been battling this madness for days. Maybe, just maybe, they weren't entirely cut off, left to make do with fading batteries and dwindling supplies. 

The firefighters exchanged worried glances. "Shipyard's still on lockdown," one pointed out. "Getting in there won't be easy."

The sailor, his pristine uniform now smudged, stepped forward. "You're with me," he said, "don't sweat it."

"All right, let's move," the other firefighter said.

They loaded the boy into the back of the truck, the slam of the door a jarring punctuation mark in the tense silence. As the engine roared to life, Washington held out a sliver of hope alongside the persistent weight of unanswered questions.
