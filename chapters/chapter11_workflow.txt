## Rough draft for chapter 11, part one.

A scream shattered Katherine's restless slumber – a sharp, piercing sound that clawed at the remnants of her dreams.  She jolted upright, heart pounding, disorientation warring with a surge of fear for her children.

But this cry held no childish terror. The sound echoed from the distance, a wail of pure alarm that sliced through the pre-dawn stillness. "Fire!"  The word floated on the wind, raw and ragged. Somewhere to the east, catastrophe had struck.

Another wail pierced the hush.  From the window, a tendril of smoke curled against the still-dark sky, carrying the acrid scent of burning pine boughs.

"Sir William!" Her voice cracked, a sharp edge of panic slicing through her usual composure.  Her fingers fumbled for familiar textures – the rough linen of her shift, the scratchy wool of an underskirt abandoned in haste on a chair.  Where was her maid?  A lifetime of being waited upon ill-prepared her for this frantic search for necessities.

The scrape of a chair in the outer room brought a flicker of relief.  Talbot's gruff answer came as a balm to her jangled nerves.  "My lady?"

Her hands, still clumsy, fastened the lacings of her bodice.  "There's danger afoot," she managed, the words tight in her throat. "And the children..."

A flicker of movement in the doorway – Mary, nursemaid to little Anne, her face pale and eyes wide.  "The fire, m'lady, it's not in the house.  Out yonder, it is." She pointed a shaking finger towards the eastern window.

Katherine's breath caught. Not fire consuming her haven, at least not yet.  Instead, it was the fearsome unknown, a force beyond her control.  Years of courtly grace warred with the primal urge to run, to gather her children and hide.   But hiding was a luxury she could no longer afford.

"Mother?"  Edward, her eldest, hovered in the doorway, eyes wide and shadowed.  Henry and little Elizabeth clung to him like frightened sparrows.  

Katherine summoned a smile that felt brittle as old leaves. "Just a village mishap, sweetheart.  Nothing to trouble ourselves with." Lies, the currency of desperate mothers. 

Sir William took a tentative step into the room. "Hold here, my lady, I will see if there is trouble." His usual gruff certainty was tinged with a tautness that mirrored her own unease.  The knight turned and left, his footsteps echoing on the ancient stone.

Silence descended, punctuated by the muffled whimpers of her frightened children. Katherine sent Mary to busy herself, the familiar rituals of childcare a fragile anchor in the swirling chaos. Alone, she paced the room, the cold hearth mocking the dread rising within her.

Was this it, then? The final blow the fates had waited years to deliver? Had Richard's spies tracked them down, vengeance cloaked in the guise of a peasant's carelessness?  Or worse, were the Nevilles behind this, their hatred of the Woodvilles as tenacious as a stubborn weed?

Every creak of the floorboards, every flicker of the dying candles, brought a fresh surge of terror. She was a hunted doe, caught in a snare of her own making, her rebellion a noose around her neck.  And her children…those innocents would pay the price for her ambition.

Heavy footsteps thumped in the hallway, followed by the rattle of a hastily buckled sword. Sir William Talbot, ever the vigilant watchdog, his scarred face etched with concern beneath the flickering candlelight.

"Lady Katherine." His nod was curt, urgency overriding usual formalities. "I've seen it myself.  A glow on the horizon – not a wildfire, more contained  But the tales…unsettling."

Talbot's words echoed Mary's earlier report, but something in his grim tone sent a fresh shiver down Katherine's spine.  She gestured towards the window. "The smoke…it hardly seems a threat."

"That's not what worries me, my lady." He glanced over his shoulder, as if fearing eavesdroppers. "The villagers speak of a blinding light, just before the fire. Father Sanclar calls it an ill portent, a sign from God."

Katherine's fingers tightened on the windowsill. Not fire, then, but something far less familiar, less controllable.  Superstition she could dismiss; a priest's warning carried more weight.  And lurking beneath the superstitious talk of divine wrath was a kernel of her own fear – what if this strange event wasn't some isolated act of nature, but the first tremor of a greater upheaval?  The safe haven of Chester, with its stout walls and loyal Mayor, suddenly beckoned.

**Chapter Eleven, part two:**

## Point of view character: Thomas Reed

**characters:** Thomas Reed, Will, John Rumbly the elder, Father Sanclar

#### Background information on Thomas Reed for the LLM

As a tanner, Thomas Reed operates his tannery to the northwest of Macclesfield, strategically placed downwind to spare the villagers from the pungent odors characteristic of his trade. His expertise in transforming animal hides into durable leather is crucial for the community, supplying materials for a variety of uses, from clothing to essential gear.

Reed's home is adjacent to his workplace, where he resides with his wife and three children. Their domestic life is intertwined with the rhythms of the tannery, where the children are accustomed to the processes of curing, soaking, and dyeing leather.

The eldest child, Gilbert, while immersed in the world of tanning through his father's trade, is captivated by the artistry and versatility of leatherworking. Recognizing the distinction between his father's role in preparing hides and the skilled craft of transforming leather into functional and decorative items, Gilbert aspires to extend his family's legacy into this refined trade.

Despite his father's expertise in tanning—a crucial first step in the leather production process—Gilbert understands that mastering leatherworking requires guidance beyond what his home environment can provide. Thus, he sets his sights on securing an apprenticeship with a master leatherworker, aiming to bridge the gap between raw material and finished product.

Reed, aware of his son's ambitions, supports Gilbert's desire to broaden his skills. The family's connections, established through Reed's supply of tanned leather to artisans across Cheshire and Derbyshire, become instrumental in Gilbert's quest. Reed leverages these relationships, proposing trades or exchanges that could facilitate an apprenticeship opportunity for Gilbert, demonstrating a father's commitment to his child's aspirations.

Gilbert's potential apprenticeship not only signifies his personal growth but also symbolizes the interdependence of trades within the community. His journey from a tanner's household to a leatherworking workshop embodies the collaborative spirit of the time, where various crafts and skills converge to sustain the local economy and enrich the cultural tapestry of the region.

The Reed family capitalizes on the seclusion afforded by their tannery's location, an area less coveted due to the odorous nature of their trade. This isolation provides them with ample land to maintain a modest homestead where they raise hogs and chickens. These animals play a dual role in the Reed household: they are a source of sustenance and contribute to the tannery's operations. The hogs, in particular, are valuable not just for their meat but also for their skins, which are processed into tough, resilient leather at the tannery.

Thomas Reed, while a skilled tanner, does not specialize in the fine art of leatherworking. As a result, his own pigskin boots, crafted from the leather he produces, are purely utilitarian. They are sturdy and functional, embodying the essence of his work, yet they lack the refined comfort and fit that a professional leatherworker might achieve. These boots, somewhat chafing and unpolished, serve as a humble testament to Reed's practical approach to his craft, emphasizing utility over elegance.

In this way, the Reed family's lifestyle and Thomas's own attire reflect their pragmatic adaptation to their environment and circumstances, demonstrating how their daily lives are interwoven with the rhythm of their tannery and the broader community's needs.

#### The Village's Reaction

#### Foreboding Signs
- Reed's seasoned instincts warn him of an ominous shift, likening the morning's strangeness to a prelude to misfortune.
- Rumbly's mention of the unusual silence and smoke contributes to the growing tension, with both men recognizing the gravity of the situation.

#### The Cry and the Community's Response
- A mysterious, mournful wail disrupts the morning, heightening the villagers' fear and leading to speculation about its source and meaning.
- Father Sanclar's dramatic interpretation of the events as divine signals stirs the villagers into a mix of fear and fervent belief, pushing them towards the church for solace.

#### Reflection and Resolution
- Despite the return of birdsong and news downplaying the fire's severity, Reed remains troubled, pondering the true nature of the morning's events and the village's quick turn to religious explanation.
- Father Sanclar's proclamation of prayer's victory over evil leaves Reed skeptical, reflecting on the balance between faith and the tangible, unexplained phenomena they've just witnessed.

#### Thomas Reed's Perspective
- Throughout the chapter, Reed's pragmatic and observant nature provides a grounded perspective on the village's reactions, contrasting with the more superstitious or religious interpretations of the events.
- His internal struggle with the village's swift turn to spiritual explanations offers insight into the varied ways communities confront and rationalize unexpected or threatening occurrences.

## Rough draft for chapter 11, part two.

Thomas Reed watched the eastern horizon with a frown marring his weathered features. The dawn light painted the distant smoke a sickly pink, a mocking echo of a peaceful sunrise. But there was no peace to be found this morning.

"Strange, it is," muttered Will, a stringy lad whose skill with a bow outweighed his years.  "Even the birds are quiet."

It was true. The usual chorus of birdsong was absent, replaced by an oppressive hush that sent an unwelcome chill down Reed's spine. The King's Forest, always an uneasy neighbor, now seemed to pulse with silent menace.

A flicker of movement caught his eye. John Rumbly, the big woodworker, a reliable man and a fine shot, was striding towards them. Reed felt a momentary flicker of relief - a familiar face amidst this mounting wrongness. But then a pang of unease struck him. Where was the younger John, usually trailing his father  like a shadow?

He tightened his grip on his bow. He was no great scholar, had no use for priests and their prophecies.  But he knew the feel of wrongness, the prickle at the back of his neck that came before a hunt gone sour or an approaching storm. This was worse. This felt like a change in the wind, a twisting of fate no mortal man could predict.

Reed watched John Rumbly approach, his usual easygoing gait replaced by a stiff stride that spoke of worry poorly concealed. "John," he greeted, keeping his voice steady. "Anything to report from your side?"

Rumbly nodded, the lines around his eyes etched deeper than usual.  "A bit of smoke, and the quiet. It sets the teeth on edge, it does."

"Aye," Reed agreed, his gaze flicking briefly towards the forest. "Where's the lad? Thought he'd be keen to see this strangeness for himself."  He tried to sound casual, but a prickle of unease made its way along his spine.

Rumbly's jaw clenched. "Off gathering kindling. Wife wanted a good fire, what with this chill in the air." His voice held a forced lightness.

Reed knew better than to push. Empty bellies made men take risks, a fact he understood too well.  Yet, the lad venturing out alone, before first light, with that unnatural glow on the horizon...it didn't sit right.

"Best keep a sharp eye, then," he said, choosing his words carefully. "No telling what these times might bring forth." There was a double meaning there, one Rumbly was sure to catch.

Their conversation was shattered by a mournful wail – raw, insistent, cutting through the morning hush. It rose and fell, an echo of some ancient lament. Rumbly went pale, his eyes widening.

"What in God's name...?" Reed's words trailed off. It wasn't the church bell, nor any signal he recognized. The sound slithered from the west, from across the river, carrying the weight of nameless dread.

The siren's wail died away, leaving the men staring at each other in stunned silence. What fresh madness was this, on top of the unnatural light and the forest's oppressive stillness?

Then, a new voice cut through the tension. "The day of reckoning!" Father Sanclar strode towards them, his usually placid face flushed with a fervent zeal. "A sign, brethren! A call to repentance before the wrath of God descends!"

Rumbly crossed himself hurriedly, fear etched deep in his weathered features. Even Reed, with his archer's practicality, felt a chill that had nothing to do with the morning air. These were God-fearing folk – the priest's words found fertile ground in their hearts.

"To the church!" Father Sanclar's voice boomed. "We must seek solace in prayer, for surely these are the end times upon us!"

The villagers, roused from their stunned silence, began to stir. Reed watched them go, a knot of unease tightening in his gut. Prayer was all well and good, but what if this strange portent was beyond even God's power to quell? What if the change twisting through the air cared naught for piety or pleas for mercy?

---

Later, as the first true rays of sunlight finally pierced the lingering smoke, an exhausted calm settled over Macclesfield. The birdsong had returned, hesitantly at first, then with growing boldness.  Reed leaned against his bow, weariness warring with the lingering unease in his bones.

The fire, whatever it had been, seemed contained. News trickled in – a strange flash, a patch of scorched earth, but nothing that couldn't be explained away by lightning and bad luck. And the unnatural quiet…well, even the woods needed to rest once in a while.  Didn't they?

Father Sanclar, leading a procession through the village, caught Reed's eye. The priest's face shone with a mix of triumph and humility.  "See, brother?" he proclaimed, "The power of prayer! Evil flees before the light of faith!"

A chorus of relieved murmurs echoed through the crowd. Reed couldn't deny there was something different in the air, a lightness he hadn't felt since the first troubling glow on the horizon.
