## rough draft:

First came the brightest flash of light Gina had ever seen. It pierced the walls of the building, the open doors framing a blinding expanse of white. The world dimmed in the aftermath, a hollow echo of before. Then, the lights flickered and died, plunging them into darkness.

Gina felt the world lurch beneath her feet, nausea threatening to rise. Muffled gasps and startled cries echoed around her as others fought the same disorienting shift. She pressed her fingers against her wildly beating pulse, a lifeline in the chaos. At least she was still alive.

The sky itself seemed to darken, the faint light through the hangar doors fading.

"Power's out!" the commander barked, his voice cutting through the rising murmurs of panic. "Everyone stay put! We need to assess!" He gestured sharply, and a group of sailors – security, Gina realized – moved towards the exit.

Overhead lights sputtered, casting grotesque shadows that danced and flickered on the dust-coated ship. Then, a crimson glow pierced the gloom – the exit sign above a side door, burning with an eerie brilliance. "Backup generator," the shipyard manager muttered, breaking away. "Excuse me,  Madam Mayor, Commander..."

As the commander and his officer huddled, their voices a tense murmur lost in the rising din, Gina felt a familiar weight descend on her shoulders – the mantle of responsibility. The sailors, responding to their officer's barked orders, moved with purpose. But the crowd…

Fear buzzed among them, amplified by the babble of voices. Whispers, shouted questions, the shrill ring of cell phones failing to connect. It was a cacophony of unease, a wildfire waiting for a spark to ignite it into full-blown panic.

Gina brought two fingers to her lips, the piercing whistle cutting through the noise. It earned her startled glances, even a questioning look from Commander Middleton. She nodded towards him, a silent plea to continue, to show that things were, if not normal, at least *controlled*.

"Folks!" she called, her voice echoing strangely in the cavernous space. "I know this is unnerving, but it's likely just a blackout. A big one, maybe, but nothing to be alarmed about!"

"My phone's dead!" a woman wailed, holding up the device as if seeking a diagnosis. "Nothing! Not even a bar of service!"

"Likely the cell towers," the man with the booming voice offered. His words sounded confident but his eyes darted about nervously. "Blackouts...they can knock those out too, you know."

An older man, his weathered face creased in thought, held up an older model battered phone. "Mine neither," he grumbled. "And this thing... this is from before the smartphones, it doesn't rely on fancy towers in town. That's radio, but the signal should reach clear to the next county." He shook his head.

Chaos threatened. One frightened question sparked another, each turning the air a little thicker.

"Hold on. I've got a radio," the head mechanic she had met earlier said. The man looked under sheet covered workbenches and rummaged through cabinets until he found what he was looking for. A portable radio. Its plastic casing was scuffed, the antenna slightly bent – a relic of a different era. Jesus, his weathered hands surprisingly gentle on the battered radio, set it down in front of Gina. A small red LED flickered, a defiant pulse of light against the encroaching gloom. "It works," he announced, a flicker of pride momentarily chasing away the worry lines etched on his face.

A crowd surged around them, drawn by the promise of information, of some connection to the outside world. The air thrummed with a desperate hope that warred with Gina's own rising unease.

A faint hiss emerged from the speaker.  Jesus turned the volume up, the hiss intensifying, then reached for the dial. His fingers traced its arc, searching…for what, exactly? Familiar voices of news anchors, the comforting static of a distant signal…anything to break this eerie silence.

But there was nothing. Not a whisper of a talk show, not a stray note of music. The hiss continued, relentless and empty.  Gina shivered. Even static, the chaotic voice of the airwaves, would have been preferable to this oppressive, unnatural quiet.

The silence stretched, each tick of the clock seeming to gouge another notch into Gina's dwindling optimism. The crowd, sensing the shift, erupted in a flurry of suggestions, their voices tinged with rising panic.

"The antenna! Maybe it's bent outta shape…"

"Batteries must be dead. Someone get some new ones!"

"Try a different radio! There's gotta be another one around here…"

Gina's gaze swept through the sea of worried faces, searching for a familiar form. There – Paul, standing amidst the throng, his usual easygoing expression replaced by a tense frown.  Their eyes met. He delivered his trademark exasperated shrug, the silent echo of what can you do? momentarily stabbing through her resolve.

But then, a flicker of a smile touched his lips – barely there, but a spark of support nonetheless. It cut through the swirling fear, a silent reassurance.  A reminder of why she'd thrown herself into this messy, unpredictable world of public service. Because when faced with chaos, when the weight of uncertainty threatened to crush her, she wasn't alone.  Someone was there, offering not answers, but the strength to keep searching for them.

"Mayor Swanson." Commander Middleton gestured towards her, interrupting Gina's swirling thoughts. She excused herself from the crowd and made her way over to the Navy side of the congregation. "Security's conducted a preliminary sweep. We need your input." He nodded towards his companions. "Lieutenant Commander Frost, my executive officer. And this is Petty Officer Irving, our lead security specialist."

Irving, a compact man with the watchful eyes of a hawk, stepped forward. His tone was clipped, but not without a trace of urgency. "Survey of the perimeter, ma'am.  Initial observation: decreased ambient light. Estimation...sun's position is inconsistent with the time of day." He pressed his lips together as if holding back a sigh.

"Further anomaly: The river…it terminates abruptly, both north and south. Treeline. Forms a rough semicircle. Awaiting aerial confirmation, but ground team reports are consistent."

Gina blinked, trying to process the words. The sun...lowered?  It had been high and bright mere moments ago.  A knot of worry tightened in her stomach.

"Frost and I were about to head to the roof for a better look, you're welcome to join us," Middleton said. "Best vantage point for an overview, Mayor.  Security's clearing a path now. Would you…?"  The unspoken question hung in the air.

Gina hesitated. The crowd, buzzing with a mix of fear and desperate curiosity, needed her here. But the answers…they might lie beyond this ship, out there in the impossible landscape.

"Petty Officer Irving," she turned to the security specialist, questions tumbling over themselves. "The trees – are they growing out of the water?"

"Negative, ma'am. River terminates as if it were the shore of a lake."

"The sun…you said its position…"

"Inconsistent, ma'am. Too low on the horizon for the time of day."

"Where is it, exactly?"

"Just above the treeline, east." Irving's voice held a note of strained patience, as if he longed to be back on the ground, gathering data, not fielding a terrified Mayor's questions.

Gina shivered, a chill unconnected to the sudden drop in temperature. "The darkness…is that because of the sun?"

"Partially, ma'am. There's cloud cover now that wasn't there before. Changes…" He trailed off, then finished bluntly, "We don't understand them yet."

---

Gina scanned the town from the rooftop of City Hall. Commander Middleton stood beside her, his jaw set. Frost and Irving flanked them, their gazes fixed on the horizon.

Across the river, on the Wabekon side, all that remained of Michigan was a jagged crescent – a testament to some unknown force that had reshaped the landscape. To the west, Belle Rive clung to the horizon, a tenuous sliver of life amidst the desolation.

"Damn near perfect circle," Frost's whisper cut through the silence. He lowered the binoculars, his voice tinged with awe and a sliver of fear. "It encloses us, completely."

They were surrounded.  The realization hit Gina with the force of a physical blow. Not just a strange shift in the landscape, but a precise, almost calculated change. The flash, the blackout – pieces of a puzzle slotted into place with chilling clarity.

To the west, wisps of smoke curled from the residential district, a disquieting sight against the normally peaceful backdrop. "Not yet a blaze," Middleton murmured, "but those spots could worsen in minutes."

Her city. Smoke rising in the distance, a blemish on the landscape. Gina watched the fire engine pull out of the station, followed by the chief's red pickup, sirens and horns a desperate chorus. Then, even louder, the primal wail of the bomb shelter siren echoed across the city. That rusty relic of the 50s, a hand-cranked horror they tested every decade, now clawed at her composure with its urgent warning.

Duty wrestled with fear in Gina's gut, her hands clenching at her sides. She needed to see this firsthand, to assess the threat, to act. But the siren shrieked its message of danger. She turned to the commander. "I need to see this firsthand," she said. It was a statement, not a question.

Middleton nodded, a flicker of concern crossing his face. "We'll send a team with you." He turned to his XO, "Frost, take as many as you need."

They descended the narrow staircase, the urgency of the moment pressing them forward. Frost barked orders, sailors assembling into groups.

Voices clamored around her, hands reaching, faces etched with anxiety. A wave of claustrophobia threatened to choke the answers from her.  She wasn't ready to reveal what she had seen, not until she had a plan, but the desperate faces demanded answers.

Gina pushed through the throng of frightened residents, reaching  the lead machinist as he tried to soothe a frantic woman clutching a child. His steady voice, a soothing balm against the rising fear, was confirmation – this was her man.

She glanced again at the red stitching on the man's blue jumpsuit. Jesus Hernandez. "Jesus," she said, her voice low, cutting through the chaos.

"It's *Jesus*" he clarified, pronouncing the name in the Spanish style.

Gina tamped down her embarrassment at an obvious error, chalking it up to the stress of the situation. It was a lesson to herself to stay focused and not let assumptions cloud her judgment.

"We need to talk, mister Hernandez. Come with me." She didn't wait for a response, turning and striding towards a sliver of space between two large tool cabinets. Hernandez hesitated, then followed.

Gina tamped down her embarrassment at an obvious error, chalking it up to the stress of the situation. It was a lesson to herself to stay focused and not let assumptions cloud her judgment.

In the dimness, she turned to face him. "I'm heading out to assess the situation," she began, "and I need someone I can trust to hold things together here until I get back."

Hernandez's face tightened. "Ma'am, with all due respect, I'm a machinist, not a…" he gestured helplessly, searching for the right word.

Gina stepped closer. "Not a leader? Mr. Hernandez, I've seen you on that shipyard floor. When the pressure's on, when those machines break down, you're the one your crew turns to. You get things done. That's the kind of leadership we need right now."

Hernandez shook his head. "Mayor, with all due respect, I appreciate the vote of confidence. But I'm not even from here. I'm from Los Angeles, I'm just here to work."

Gina felt a flicker of surprise, quickly masked. "Doesn't matter. You've been here long enough to see this town isn't just a paycheck, right?"

A long moment stretched between them. Finally, those broad shoulders squared, and she saw a flicker of resolve in his eyes. "Yes, ma'am," he said, his voice steadier. "What do you need me to do?"

She didn't answer. Not right away. Gina's relief was a tangible wave washing over her. That settled it. It was time to address the crowd. 

Gina's voice cut through the rising panic like a cleaver through cold flesh. "Everyone, listen up!" She stood atop the workbench, a sea of anxious faces turned toward her.

"This is not a drill. We've got trouble," she said, no point in sugarcoating it. "But we are not strangers to hard times, are we? We'll handle this, same as we've done before." She paused, scanning the crowd, searching for a familiar face.

Her eyes settled on a broad-shouldered man near the back. Hernandez. Lead machinist at the shipyard, the man knew how to keep gears turning under pressure. She locked eyes with him. "Mr. Hernandez, step forward."

The crowd parted. Hernandez moved to the front, his expression a mix of apprehension and determination.

"This man," Gina jerked a thumb at Hernandez, "Jesus Hernandez," she pronouced carefully, "is your acting deputy while I'm gone. I've witnessed his leadship firsthand. I'm heading out to see what we're up against, and he's got the reins until I get back. Whatever he says, goes. Clear?"

A murmur rippled through the crowd; nods, whispers, a few hesitant glances cast towards Hernandez.

Gina dropped from the hood of the SUV, landing lightly beside the machinist. "Hernandez, I need you to keep things organized. We'll send updates as soon as we have them. Get a headcount, set up watches – whatever’s needed. I'm counting on you."

Hernandez squared his shoulders. His voice was steady when he spoke. “Yes, ma’am.”
