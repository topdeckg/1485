Let's dig into the scene where the men from Wabekon enter the fire station . It's not a long walk, little more than a mile to cross through the newly appeared woods, skirting what used to be the river

This is not how a first person narrative is written. Every scene starts with the character, not the location. This lets the reader know from the first words who the POV character is.  Starting with the location ("In the organized chaos of the Belle Rive fire station") is a top down setting as if the reader is an audience member watching the curtains open on a stage. We want to be inside the character's mind, seeing and hearing with them.

here's an example of the type of opening I'm thinking of:

Lieutenant Commander Frost wiped the seat from his brow. It was unusually warm for  mid march, another indication nibbling at the back of his mind that they might not be where they thought.

He used a red ballpoint pen with the words Belle Rive Fire printed on the side to tick off his reminder note about food in residential homes. He looked up to encourage Lieutenant Jones to continue his report.

"No sign of any local law enforcement, the mayor tells us the cops mostly patrol the areas closer to the freeway on and off ramps." Jones read from his own notepad, flipping the paper up and over to the next sheet.

---

Lieutenant Commander Joshua Frost wiped sweat from his brow, an unwelcome companion in the already sweltering atmosphere of the fire station, now a makeshift command center. The abnormal warmth for mid-March niggled at him, a silent whisper that they were far from where they ought to be.

Clutching a red ballpoint pen, emblazoned with "Belle Rive Fire" in fading letters, Frost checked off another item from his list—food in residential homes—a mundane task amid the chaos. He glanced up, nodding at Lieutenant Jones to proceed with his report.

Jones, with a slight furrow in his brow, relayed the latest updates, the rustle of his notepad filling the brief silence between them. "No sign of any local law enforcement," he reported, his voice steady but tinged with concern. "The mayor says the cops are usually stationed near the freeway exits."

Frost's mind raced as he processed the information, the gravity of their isolation sinking in. The community's reliance on them, in the absence of usual law enforcement, underscored the urgency of their mission. He leaned in, his focus sharpening, as he prepared to delve deeper into the strategy that would guide them through this crisis.

Frost's concentration was momentarily broken by the creak of the fire station's heavy door swinging open. Two men, unfamiliar and clearly anxious, stepped into the organized chaos, their eyes scanning the room until they landed on him. Despite not knowing a soul in this town before the crisis, Frost had quickly become a beacon for anyone seeking aid or answers.

He stood up, the list momentarily forgotten, as the men approached. "Can we help you?" he asked, his tone inviting yet authoritative.

Garret, the taller of the two, took the lead. "Lieutenant Commander Frost? We've come from Wabekon. We need to talk to you about the situation there." His voice carried a weight of urgency, underscored by the worried glance he exchanged with his companion, Jim.

Frost gestured to a pair of vacant chairs across from his makeshift desk. "Sit down. Tell me everything." As they settled, Frost noted their rugged appearances, the kind borne of sleepless nights and relentless worry.

Jim, fidgeting with the hem of his jacket, chimed in, "It's about the daycare and the assisted living facility in Wabekon. They're cut off, and we're running out of supplies fast."

The reality of Wabekon's plight hit Frost with a jolt. Here was a new, pressing challenge, demanding immediate attention. His mind shifted gears, already mapping out potential solutions even as he listened intently to the men's detailed account of their town's predicaments.

"The river's rise has isolated them completely," Garret continued, his voice laced with a mix of desperation and hope. "We managed to get a message out, but we're not sure how much longer they can hold on."

Frost nodded, signaling Lieutenant Jones with a subtle glance. The gears of response were already in motion, his team attuned to the urgency of the situation. "We'll coordinate a rescue and supply drop," Frost assured them, his voice firm with resolve. "We have boats and can cut a path through the woods. We'll start immediately."

Relief, mingled with lingering concern, washed over Garret and Jim's faces. They had reached the right person, a sentiment reflected in their grateful nods. Frost, meanwhile, was already on his feet, the leader within him taking charge, driven by a deep-seated commitment to safeguard these communities against the relentless tide of unforeseen challenges.

As Garret and Jim introduced themselves and their purpose, Frost took a moment to process the information. The other side of the river. The phrase echoed in his mind, a stark reminder of the broader crisis at hand. It was all too easy to become ensnared in the immediate issues of Belle Rive, from the fires to the myriad subsequent challenges that seemed to cascade without end.

A small part of him wanted to direct a flicker of irritation toward Mayor Swanson and her endless catalog of problems that invariably landed on his shoulders. But he quickly quashed that impulse, recognizing it for the fleeting shadow of selfishness it was.

His focus had been so intensely tunneled on Belle Rive's immediate crises—extinguishing the fires, providing for the displaced, securing the area—that the plight of those across the river had momentarily slipped from his view. It was a lapse he couldn't afford, a lesson swiftly learned.

Garret and Jim's arrival was a stark call to widen his lens, to remember that their mission extended beyond the immediate vicinity, reaching out to those in Wabekon who were equally ensnared in the aftermath of this catastrophe.

"I see," Frost finally responded, his voice steady, betraying none of his internal reprimand. "You did the right thing coming here. Tell me more about the situation in Wabekon. We're here to help, not just Belle Rive, but all affected communities."

As the men detailed the dire circumstances across the river, Frost's mind was already in motion, strategizing, planning. They needed to act fast, to extend their resources and aid beyond the immediate reach of Belle Rive, to those on the other side of the river who were counting on them just as much. The realization reignited his sense of duty, reinforcing the commitment he held to each person affected by this unprecedented crisis.

Lieutenant Commander Joshua Frost's gaze lingered on the two strangers who had just entered the makeshift command center. The fire station, now the heart of crisis operations, was bustling, yet the arrival of these men cut through the constant hum of activity.

"Are you city officials, or employees? Have you spoken with Mayor Swanson or Chief Scarborough?" Frost inquired, seeking to place them within the framework he'd been navigating since the crisis began.

Jim shuffled his feet, a clear sign of discomfort or perhaps uncertainty. "Oh, well, Wabekon is in Michigan, you know, the U.P.," he offered, trying to paint the geographical picture for Frost.

"Upper peninsula," Garret chimed in, providing clarity. It was evident they were out of their element, cast into a role they never expected to play.

Frost's mind raced as he realigned his mental map of the region, integrating this new piece of the puzzle. Wabekon, a community on the other side of the river, now thrust into their circle of concern. "I understand," he acknowledged. "Who is in charge in Wabekon? Is it one of you?"

The men exchanged a glance that spoke volumes of the chaos back home. It was Garret who broke the silence, his voice tinged with a mix of resignation and hope. "Nobody's in charge. At least nobody was when we decided to walk over here. We tried getting attention with mirrors and an airhorn, but I guess you guys were busy." His gesture toward the window, where smoke still lingered in the air, underscored the gravity of Belle Rive's own crisis.

Jim leaned forward, his eyes meeting Frost's. "So I guess you guys could be in charge. You're the Navy, right?" The hint of desperation in his voice was unmistakable, a clear call for leadership in a time when their own community's structure had faltered.

Frost absorbed their words, the weight of their request settling on his shoulders. They were right; the Navy was here, and with that came a responsibility not just to Belle Rive but to neighboring communities like Wabekon. His decision would impact lives, a fact he was acutely aware of as he nodded slowly, affirming their unspoken plea for help.

"We'll do what we can," Frost assured them, his voice firm with the resolve of a man who understood the breadth of his duty. As they began to outline Wabekon's needs, Frost listened intently, his mind already forming the framework of a response plan. This was more than a mission; it was a testament to their commitment to serve, to extend their reach wherever it was needed most.

Frost rose from his makeshift desk, an air of resolve enveloping him. "Thank you again for coming. We're going to put together a group," he stated, offering a firm handshake to signify his commitment to their cause.

Jim, with a glimmer of hope in his eyes, grasped Frost's hand firmly. "We'd like to join you, sir," he declared, a sense of duty in his voice. Garret, not to be left out, extended his hand next, receiving a similarly firm handshake from Frost.

"Lieutenant Jones will see to that," Frost directed, casting a meaningful glance at Jones to convey the urgency of the situation. Jones nodded in understanding, prepared to integrate the two men from Wabekon into their response team.

With a nod to Ramirez, Frost signaled his intent to step outside the office. They moved through the bustling hallway of the fire station, now a nerve center of crisis management. "Let's see if Swanson has any insights into the Wabekon side of the river," Frost suggested as they made their way to the vehicle staging area, the heart of their logistical operations.

Upon reaching the mayor, they found her deep in discussion with her husband, Paul. Frost had gleaned that Paul was a retired school teacher, though his interactions with him had been minimal. Paul's current involvement, however, seemed to be more than just that of a concerned spouse; he was actively participating in the crisis response, albeit in a seemingly overwhelmed state.

As they approached, they caught the tail end of Paul's exhaustive litany of community grievances, his voice tinged with frustration. The mayor, entrenched in her role as Belle Rive's leader even amidst personal exhaustion, was diligently taking notes at a card table that seemed far too flimsy for the weight of the crisis they bore.

"Hold on, Paul, not everyone has your steel trap for a brain. I gotta write this down," Gina quipped with a weary smile, attempting to inject a hint of levity into their grim circumstances.

Frost cleared his throat gently, announcing his and Ramirez's presence. "Mayor Swanson, we need to discuss the situation in Wabekon. It seems their plight is closely tied to our own, and they're in dire need of assistance," he said, his voice carrying the gravity of the new challenge they faced.

Gina rolled her eyes, an action Frost assumed to be an involuntary reaction from a woman who was typically the epitome of self-control. The stress of the situation was palpable, and even Mayor Swanson, with her usually unflappable demeanor, was showing signs of strain under the relentless tide of demands and decisions.

Frost waited patiently for her attention, understanding the myriad pressures she faced. When Gina finally looked up, her expression shifted from one of momentary frustration to focused concern.

"Sorry about that, Lieutenant Commander. It's just been... overwhelming," she admitted, offering a brief glimpse into her own challenges amidst the crisis. "What's the situation in Wabekon?"

Frost quickly outlined the predicament, detailing the isolation, the urgent need for supplies, and the vulnerability of the daycare and assisted living facility. As he spoke, Gina's note-taking became more fervent, her earlier weariness replaced by the urgency of the new information.

"We need to coordinate a response," Frost concluded, his tone leaving no room for doubt about the gravity of the situation.

Gina nodded, her mind already racing through potential strategies and resources. "We'll do whatever we can. Paul, can you..." she began, but Paul was already on his feet, ready to assist in whatever capacity he could.

The collaboration between military and civilian leadership, embodied in Frost and Swanson's exchange, highlighted the communal spirit driving their efforts. Despite the exhaustion and the relentless pace of the unfolding crisis, their shared commitment to aiding those in need remained unwavering, a beacon of hope amid the chaos.

"What do we need?" Mayor Swanson inquired, her pen poised above the notepad, ready to jot down the essentials for the mission to Wabekon.

Frost didn't hesitate. "A chainsaw, for one," he stated, knowing the importance of clearing a path through the dense woods separating the two towns. "A gas-powered one, with a pull start," he clarified, envisioning the type of equipment that would be necessary for the task at hand.

Paul, who had been quietly listening, suddenly chimed in, his gaze shifting as if he was rummaging through his mental inventory of the town's resources. "Hold on," he interjected, a spark of realization in his eyes. He turned to his wife. "Two doors down from us, what's his name?"

"Barker?" Gina suggested, trying to follow her husband's train of thought.

"No, not from here, from our house, the one with the wrought iron gate," Paul clarified, his memory honing in on the neighbor he was thinking of.

"George Harrow, but he's in Florida," Gina responded, piecing together the puzzle her husband was laying out.

"Well, he won't miss his chainsaw then, will he?" Paul concluded with a half-smile, suggesting a pragmatic solution to their immediate need.

Frost appreciated the quick thinking. "If we can borrow Mr. Harrow's chainsaw, that would be a great start," he acknowledged, noting the mayor's nod of approval as she scribbled down the action item.

This brief exchange, marked by a blend of urgency and community-minded improvisation, encapsulated the collective effort to address the crisis. With each piece of the puzzle falling into place, Frost felt a growing confidence in their ability to extend their reach to Wabekon, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty.

Frost took the paper from Paul, examining the hastily sketched map and the address noted on the side. It was only a few blocks away, a manageable distance in the current situation. He appreciated the efficiency of Paul's directions and knew exactly what to do next.

Raising his voice to cut through the ambient noise of the fire station, he called for a messenger. The response was swift; a sailor, still donned in her dress white uniform, maneuvered her bicycle into the vehicle bay, a testament to the adaptability the crisis demanded.

"Aye, Commander?" she inquired, coming to a halt before him.

Frost extended the paper toward her. "This is directions to a house where we can find a chainsaw," he explained, his tone carrying the urgency of their mission. "Paul here will give you the details."

Paul, stepping forward, handed the paper to the sailor, his finger tracing the route on the map. "It's just a few blocks from here," he elaborated. "The house belongs to George Harrow, but he's currently out of town. We need his chainsaw—it's likely in his shed or garage."

Frost added, "You'll need to take one of the bike trailers," ensuring the sailor had the means to transport the chainsaw back to the fire station.

"Yes, sir, I've got it," the sailor confirmed, her voice brimming with determination. With the map and instructions in hand, she mounted her bicycle once again, ready to undertake the mission.

As the sailor pedaled away, Frost felt a surge of gratitude for the collaborative spirit that had taken hold among the crew and the local residents. Each individual, whether a sailor, a mayor, or a retired school teacher, was playing a vital role in navigating the unfolding crisis, their collective efforts a beacon of hope in the face of adversity.
