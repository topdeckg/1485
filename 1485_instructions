Here's a comprehensive data sheet outlining the Assiti Shards genre, crafted to highlight key elements and offer guidance for potential storylines within this fictional universe:
Genre Defining Traits:
 * Core Premise: Displacement out of place and time due to the chaotic interaction of "Assiti Shards" with Earth. Characters/objects face abrupt cultural and scientific dislocation through an established fictional cause with unpredictable results.
 * Historical Grounding: Settings are predominantly tied to specific historical periods on Earth. Accuracy ranges from meticulous research to a broader 'spirit of the era', but historical realism forms the backdrop to the extraordinary.
 * Technology vs. Resource Challenge: Modern characters often have a technological or knowledge advantage due to their displacement. Conflict derives from limited resources, communication barriers, and unexpected vulnerabilities introduced by their 'stranding' in the past.
 * Ethical Considerations: Central question of how far the displaced will go to survive, regain agency, or influence the historical timeline for personal agendas. This generates internal friction and diverse, non-binary solutions instead of easy 'good vs. evil' approaches.
Common Archetypes & Motives:
 * The Survivor: Prior skills may or may not transfer. Main focuses are practical problem-solving, adaptation, and navigating unforeseen cultural hurdles to ensure basic survival within the time period they find themselves in.
 * The Historian: Offers vital context and perspective; can struggle between scholarly detachment vs. the human drama unfolding. Their expertise is both a strength and makes them acutely aware of the risks of temporal distortion.
 * The Idealist: Clinging to "non-interference" in historical events. Morality clashes with necessity, creating inner turmoil for this character while often becoming a voice of conscience against those who see opportunity in time travel.
 * The Exploiter: Seeks to use their historical and technological advantage for personal power or to reshape the past to benefit their 'original' time.  These morally grey characters drive plot through schemes and alliances.
Story Potential Guidelines:
 * Emphasize Limitations: Even a well-armed modern protagonist struggles in a strange past. Technology malfunctions, cultural misunderstandings, and depletion of resources are key narrative engines to prevent predictable resolution.
 * Unexpected Vulnerabilities: The familiar becomes unpredictable within a displaced setting. Sickness that modern characters are immune to, social codes that lead to violence, or tech failing from lack of infrastructure to sustain it are examples to leverage.
 * Internal Dynamics: Conflict from within groups is as compelling as external threats. Varying backgrounds, pre-existing rivalries, and differing viewpoints on ethics create tensions that can either strengthen or destroy these accidental 'colonizers' of a historical era.
 * Scope Matters:  Stories range from small-scale human struggle (surviving with a group in a foreign time) to epic plots (altering major historical events with knowledge/tech, encountering remnants of other Assiti Shard incidents). Decide this early to focus tone and pacing.
Additional Observations:
 * Crossover Potential: This established universe offers inherent appeal both to the history-minded and those looking for sci-fi with less focus on 'hard science' explanations.  Leverage pre-existing settings and characters from earlier works.
 * Diverse Time Jumps: The focus on 'Earth history' still allows for a wide span of eras to play in. Underdeveloped regions and events outside European focus offer fertile ground for new narratives without retreading well-known stories.
 * Legacy Questions: Beyond immediate survival, consider the long-term effect of their presence. Are they forgotten by history, become myths, or fundamentally alter future progress with their knowledge/presence? This adds gravitas to decisions made in the narrative present.
This genre is all about exploring the "what-if" of being thrust into circumstances fundamentally unlike the familiar. By leaning into the chaos, ethical ambiguity, and unique limitations set up by the Assiti Shards, you can build immersive and resonant narratives.

This story will be in the style of 1632 and The Ring of Fire series by Eric Flint. It involves a crew of military and civilians trapped in 1485 near the end of The War of the Roses. The main characters in this story are well educated and intelligent problem solvers. The tone of the novel is influenced by books such as The Martian by Andy Weir and the Bobiverse by Dennis E. Taylor.  Problem solving through engineering and invention.
With that in mind, to serve the story the characters will be comfortable with any changes to the timeline. The reason that their presence alone has already invalidated the past that they came from. The three factions on board the Hyperion are the military, diplomacy, and engineering groups. The military characters are focused on security, threat assessment, and defense. The diplomats are taking the opportunity to attempt to bring an end to the War of the roses, a peaceful end. The engineers have several goals: firstly to raise the standard of living, provide safety and comfort as well as solving technical issues. And secondly, to figure out how the hell they got here and how do they get back home?
Each member of the team is determined to cooperate as a whole. All of their goals serve one another. They all require safety and security, they are happy to delegate that authority to the military members. Everything becomes much harder to do if they are stuck in the middle of a country which is in the middle of a civil war. Everyone is supporting the diplomat's goals. They all want to get home and they know to do so they are going to need an advanced level of technology. That requires an unavoidable need to create an industrial and technological revolution centuries ahead of schedule.
The primary diplomatic goals were twofold. Firstly an end to the War of the roses as quickly and as peacefully as possible. Secondly, independence. An exclave for a new nation. A new nation in partnership with a New England. This initial partnership will make their new country a client state of England. Sharing technology and infrastructure.
The story is told in third person past tense from ba variety of point of views.

The primary point of view character is of Dr. Mitchell Drinkwater, PhD, Senior Chief Petty Officer Electrician's Mate, E8, US Navy, retired.
 * Currently living in a New England shaker style cottage with his wife, Emily, on unincorporated land within Franklin County, Maine.
 * Born 1983. Currently 52 years old. (Year 2035).
