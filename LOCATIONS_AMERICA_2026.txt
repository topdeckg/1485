# American buildings and locations within the Ring of Fire

This file contains the list of locations from Marinette, Wisconsin and Menominee, Michigan that was brought to the year 1485.

The centerpoint of the hemispherical area tranported through time is the Menominee River, near the docks of the Marinette Marine Shipyard.

The circular anomaly is about 2500 feet or 750 meters in radius. That's about 450 acres, 19.6 million square feet or 1.8 square kilometers.

The location they are brought to is some 6 kilometers between the medieveal towns of Macclesfield and Buxton on the border between Cheshire and Derbyshire.

## On the southwest side of the river (Marinette, Wisconsin):

**Great Lakes Shipbuilding & Ironworks:** Originally founded to support the war effort, grew into a robust shipbuilding complex. Post-WWII, it diversified, producing a variety of vessels from commercial carriers to advanced naval ships. With Superior Industrial Holdings' acquisition, the facility saw significant expansion, upgrading its docks and incorporating cutting-edge design and manufacturing technologies. As part of the Navalis Marine Group and in partnership with Pendragon Defense, the complex became a hub for innovation in maritime defense solutions.

The USS Constellation, a testament to this innovation, was constructed here. This frigate, equipped with the latest in naval combat technology, stealth capabilities, and an advanced propulsion system, is designed for versatility and operability in various naval missions. Its presence in the river serves as a symbol of American industrial prowess and military strength, now paradoxically positioned in a time where its very existence is an anomaly.

### Complex Description

1. **Eastern Edge Structure:** This elongated building functions as a multifaceted space. The narrower half is dedicated to precision assembly and smaller craft repairs, while the wider section houses administrative offices for project management.

2. **Primary Construction Warehouse:** The heart of the complex, this colossal double-length warehouse is where the USS Constellation was pieced together. The vast interior is equipped with towering cranes, assembly lines, and the latest in naval engineering technology.

3. **Rectangular Service Building:** Flanked by stockpiles of materials, this facility, with its protruding extensions, serves as a central hub for equipment maintenance and storage, crucial for the upkeep of the shipyard's operations.

4. **Central Headquarters:** A compact square building, presumed to be the nerve center of the complex. Surrounding shipping containers contain critical components for ship outfitting and serve as temporary storage for sensitive equipment.

5. **Large Fabrication Hall:** Positioned to the north, this building is the primary site for constructing ship components. The interior buzzes with welders and fabricators shaping the steel that forms the skeletons of future vessels.

6. **Smallest Facility:** Despite its size, this building is a beehive of activity, likely for specialized tasks like electronics fitting or perhaps a training center for skilled workers.

7. **Design and Engineering Building:** The steeply pitched roof with skylights suggests a space where ship designs come to life. It's possibly where draftsmen and engineers work on blueprints, illuminated by natural light.

8. **Narrow Longitudinal Building:** This structure, running parallel to the fabrication hall, is likely used for storing long components of ships, such as masts or hull beams, given its slender shape and proximity to the construction zones.

The USS Constellation, moored in the river, serves as the crown jewel of the complex. It's a sophisticated frigate equipped with state-of-the-art naval technology, including advanced combat systems and a modern propulsion matrix, prepared for rigorous service yet now facing a time where its capabilities are beyond imagination.

**United Maritime Assurance**: A marine classification organization with a heritage dating back to the mid-19th century, dedicated to ensuring the safety and regulation of sea-going vessels and marine infrastructure.

**St. Michael's Lutheran Fellowship**: A historical church that serves as a pillar in the community, its roots run deep and intertwine with the town's lineage. The church provides not only spiritual guidance but also serves as a gathering place for the townspeople, with a narrative thread that could touch on the early life of Martin Luther in this alternate history setting.
**Harper Building Solutions**: A leading innovator in intelligent building management, Harper Building Solutions is known for its cutting-edge smart building technologies and has a rich history of transforming indoor environments with their digital solutions.

**Lakeside Marine Tech & Trade Hub**: This institution is at the forefront of vocational education for marine applications, featuring facilities for a wide range of technical skills including welding, electrical engineering, and computer sciences, crucial for both commercial and naval craftsmanship.

**Advanced ChemTech**: Established in the 1980s, Advanced ChemTech has built a reputation as a premier custom chemical producer, specializing in complex organic syntheses for various industrial sectors, from agriculture to high-tech industries, ensuring client formulas are produced to exacting standards.
Here are alternative versions for the establishments you've listed, maintaining the essence of each:

### Wisconsin Suburban Homes - Ring of Fire Impact Data Sheet

**Location and Structure:**
- On the edge of the anomaly's Wisconsin side, 19 American suburban single-family homes are affected. Architecturally typical of the early 21st century, featuring mixed designs from ranch to two-story structures.

**Event Damage:**
- Several homes were bisected by the event boundary, causing structural damage and subsequent fires. These incidents challenge the local fire department, which must adapt to firefighting without standard city water pressure.

### Michigan Suburban Homes - Ring of Fire Impact Data Sheet

**Location and Structure:**
- On the Michigan side, 42 homes lie on the periphery of the affected area. These homes represent a suburban neighborhood, with varying sizes and styles, from modern constructions to more traditional, mid-20th-century builds.

**Event Damage:**
- The event's edge sliced through portions of these homes, with some experiencing significant damage. The fires resulting from this traumatic spatial division require immediate attention, forcing the community and fire responders to employ creative measures due to the lack of conventional water supply.

The firefighters face the monumental task of navigating through disrupted geography. With the disappearance of the Menominee River, they now have direct land access between the two cities, allowing them to drive to areas previously divided by water. However, the event has placed a swath of forest where roads once were, obstructing their path. To reach the Bridge Street Bridge and the damaged homes, they need to rapidly clear a path through the dense forest. Without the usual city water pressure, they must also devise alternative firefighting methods, possibly relying on water from the new lake, creating makeshift water relays, or employing chemical fire retardants from nearby facilities.
