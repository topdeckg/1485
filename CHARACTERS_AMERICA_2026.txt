## Commander Joshua Frost

**Position:** Executive Officer, USS Constellation "Blue Crew"

* **Rank:**  Commander (US Navy)
* **Age:**  Mid-to-late 40s (experienced, established in his career)
* **Prior Assignments/Experience:** 
    * Extensive list of ship assignments, showcasing his competence and dedication.
    * Potentially served under Captain Devers in the past, adding to his current resentment. 
* **Education:**  U.S. Naval Academy Graduate (typical path for officers)

**Personality & Leadership Style**

* **Demeanor:**  Professional, but with a hint of hidden bitterness.  He can be respectful, yet his frustration simmers just beneath the surface.
* **Strengths:**  Highly skilled officer, meticulous, reliable leader. 
* **Weaknesses:**  Holds onto grudges, struggles to let go of the past, which can cloud his judgment. Impatient with those he perceives as less experienced.  
* **Relationship with the Captain:**  Strained but professional. They acknowledge each other's skills, but there's a lack of trust and warmth. 
* **Reputation Among the Crew:**  Admired for his expertise, but some find him intimidating.  The "blue crew" might be torn between loyalty to him and their new Captain.
* **Key Quote:**  "There's a right way and a wrong way to do things. Shortcuts always come back to bite you in the end." (Highlights his dedication to order and his potential resistance to unorthodox methods.)

**Narrative Considerations**

* **Conflict Potential:** Will he try to undermine Captain Middleton, subtly sabotage the mission, or eventually reconcile with his role on the Constellation? This could create internal tension within the crew.
* **Source of Expertise:**  Despite his frustrations, Commander Frost possesses invaluable knowledge about the Constellation's systems and protocols.  Can he be a reluctant asset to Captain Middleton during a crisis?
* **Thematic Connection:**  Frost represents the "old guard" – experienced but potentially inflexible.  His arc could explore the challenges of adapting to new leadership and the importance of letting go of past grievances. 

**Additional Thoughts**

* **The Transfer:**  Is the transfer request recent, or has it been hanging over his head for a while?  This can impact his motivation and willingness to engage with the crew. 
* **A Change of Heart?:**  Will something transpire during the journey that makes him reconsider leaving the Constellation? Perhaps he rediscovers a sense of purpose, or finds a way to work effectively with Captain Middleton. 

Here's a look at Commander Joshua Frost's civilian side, focusing on his interests and personality outside of his naval life:

* **Family Man:**  Don't make him a cliché absentee father/husband. He's devoted to his family, perhaps a wife and teenage children. This is likely where his resentment stems from - the transfer feels like another sacrifice, disrupting their settled routine.
* **Home:** Lives in a meticulous, well-maintained house in a quiet suburb.  The order mirrors his need for control, offering contrast to the potentially chaotic life onboard a ship.   
* **Hobbies:** 
    * Running:  He's disciplined, enjoys the solitude and physical challenge.  Likely has early morning runs scheduled into his week.
    * History Buff:  Reads biographies and historical non-fiction.  He finds comfort in the past, where rules were clearer and there was a satisfyingly definitive outcome.
    * Restoring Old Tools: He finds a sense of peace in restoring old hand tools, woodworking planes, etc.  There's something satisfying about taking something worn-down and making it functional again.

* **Tastes**  

    * Music:  Jazz, particularly Big Band era. Appreciates the complexity of the arrangements, the order within potential improvisation.  
    * TV Shows:  Watches documentaries (historical, nature), and procedurals where there's a clear formula and sense of justice being restored. 
    * Movies:  Enjoys war films and classic espionage thrillers, where strategies and tactics play a significant role.
    * Books: Tom Clancy-style thrillers, where there are clear heroes and villains. May also enjoy historical fiction with strong leadership figures. 

**Exploring His Civilian Side in Your Story**

* **Contrast and Conflict:** His civilian life is about structure and control. Use this to highlight how difficult it can be for him to adapt to the unpredictable nature of life at sea, especially under a new Captain.
* **Relatable Aspects:** While he might initially come across as rigid, glimpses into his family life or moments when he lets his guard down could offer a more vulnerable side to the character.
* **A Touch of Irony:** Perhaps Commander Frost, the history buff, enjoys a good swashbuckling film despite his disdain for unorthodox naval tactics. This can hint at a more adventurous side he suppresses in his professional life.

**Additional Notes:**

* These are just suggestions! Feel free to swap things out based on your overall vision for the character.
* You can use his civilian persona as a window into his inner conflicts. Perhaps his enjoyment of jazz subtly reveals a side of him that enjoys complexity more than he lets on.

## Joanna "Jo" Washington

Position: Corporal in the Marines

A skilled marksman with two consecutive competition wins under her belt, leads a squad of Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) Marines.  LAR units specialize in rapid deployment and reconnaissance, making them an agile and adaptable force. Her squad is participating in a joint training exercise aboard the USS Constellation, a cutting-edge frigate.  This exercise will take them to North Manitou Island, where they'll be deployed for maneuvers. 

The addition of this LAR unit is unusual, as Marines are not standard crew on frigates. This highlights the experimental nature of the Constellation's maiden voyage and the potential for unforeseen complications. As the Constellation navigates the Great Lakes, both Washington's squad and the ship's crew are about to be tested in ways they could never have imagined when a sudden, inexplicable event hurls them into the year 1485.
 
With her rifle skills, cool demeanor, and unexpected situation, has the potential to be a compelling character in the alternate history scenario. Here's how to build upon her profile and explore her unique challenges and opportunities:

Joanna's Initial Experience

* Ring of Fire Shock: Imagine the disorientation of being suddenly transported with her squad into a forest in 1485.  The chaos, fear, and immediate need for situational awareness are amplified by their surroundings.
* Marksman Out of Place: Joanna's expertise lies in precision shooting.  In a time of swords and bows, her superior weaponry is initially more of a curiosity than a tactical advantage.
* Chain of Command: Is her squad intact? Who is she taking orders from? The event may disrupt usual authority, forcing her to step up and think independently.

Adapting in the New World

* Gender Expectations:  Even with modern sensibilities, she'll face immediate challenges due to her gender. Initial disguise as a male might be necessary for safety and acceptance.
* Unfamiliar Territory: Joanna will need to quickly learn 15th-century social norms, language, and potential dangers. Finding allies or locals to translate and explain will be crucial for survival.
* Proving Herself: Beyond her rifle, what other skills does she possess? Navigation, first aid, or even basic leadership abilities could become invaluable in this unfamiliar world.

Narrative Potential

* Fish-out-of-Water Struggles: Early interactions with 1485 locals could highlight her misunderstandings and the limitations of her training (modern war vs. medieval skirmishes).
* Inner Growth: Joanna will likely question her own identity and value as a Marine in this new context. Can she adapt her skills and find new ways to contribute? 
* Unexpected Teacher: Joanna could end up teaching those around her practical concepts, influencing their approach to problems, even if it's as simple as basic sanitation.

Light Armored Reconnaissance vehicle carried by the Constellation:

**Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV)**

* Role: Highly mobile, armored vehicle for rapid deployment and reconnaissance missions.

**Key Features:**

* Armaments: 
    * Medium-caliber automatic cannon (offers greater range and firepower than any 15th-century equivalent)
    * Anti-armor capability (exact nature can be left vague to maintain an  air of mystery surrounding the ARV's capabilities)

* Sensors & Communication: 
    * Advanced sensor suite (emphasize its ability to detect threats beyond visual range)
    * Networked communications (implies potential to coordinate with other units, creating the illusion of having more military force than just the single ARV)

* Mobility: 
    * Robust cross-country and on-road performance 
    * Water mobility (could be crucial depending on the terrain where the ARV ends up)

* Other Systems:  
    * Deployable autonomous drones (leave specifics vague – are they aerial or ground-based?)
    * Electronic warfare capabilities (could be explained as 'disrupting enemy communications' to those in 1485)

The inclusion of the Light Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV) aboard the Constellation is unorthodox. However, it serves a crucial purpose for this maiden voyage.

Joint Training Exercise: The ARV is part of a Marine Corps training exercise scheduled during our deployment. This innovative vehicle is designed for rapid deployment and reconnaissance on land. 

Unforeseen Advantages: While not standard frigate equipment, the ARV's advanced sensors and communication systems could prove valuable in unanticipated situations. 

Limited Footprint:  The ARV is housed within the hangar and wouldn't impede normal ship operations.  Its presence is purely for training purposes during this shakedown cruise.
