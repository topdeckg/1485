* **Weaknesses:**  Holds onto grudges, struggles to let go of the past, which can cloud his judgment. Impatient with those he perceives as less experienced.  
* **Relationship with the Captain:**  Strained but professional. They acknowledge each other's skills, but there's a lack of trust and warmth. 
* **Reputation Among the Crew:**  Admired for his expertise, but some find him intimidating.  The "blue crew" might be torn between loyalty to him and their new Captain.

**Narrative Considerations**

* **Source of Expertise:**  Despite his frustrations, Commander Frost possesses invaluable knowledge about the Constellation's systems and protocols.  Can he be a reluctant asset to Captain Middleton during a crisis?

* **A Change of Heart?:**  Will something transpire during the journey that makes him reconsider leaving the Constellation? Perhaps he rediscovers a sense of purpose, or finds a way to work effectively with Captain Middleton. 

Here's a look at Commander Joshua Frost's civilian side, focusing on his interests and personality outside of his naval life:

* **Family Man:**  Don't make him a cliché absentee father/husband. He's devoted to his family, perhaps a wife and teenage children. This is likely where his resentment stems from - the transfer feels like another sacrifice, disrupting their settled routine.
* **Home:** Lives in a meticulous, well-maintained house in a quiet suburb.  The order mirrors his need for control, offering contrast to the potentially chaotic life onboard a ship.   
* **Hobbies:** 
    * Running:  He's disciplined, enjoys the solitude and physical challenge.  Likely has early morning runs scheduled into his week.
    * History Buff:  Reads biographies and historical non-fiction.  He finds comfort in the past, where rules were clearer and there was a satisfyingly definitive outcome.
    * Restoring Old Tools: He finds a sense of peace in restoring old hand tools, woodworking planes, etc.  There's something satisfying about taking something worn-down and making it functional again.

* **Tastes**  

    * Music:  Jazz, particularly Big Band era. Appreciates the complexity of the arrangements, the order within potential improvisation.  
    * TV Shows:  Watches documentaries (historical, nature), and procedurals where there's a clear formula and sense of justice being restored. 
    * Movies:  Enjoys war films and classic espionage thrillers, where strategies and tactics play a significant role.
    * Books: Tom Clancy-style thrillers, where there are clear heroes and villains. May also enjoy historical fiction with strong leadership figures. 

**Exploring His Civilian Side in Your Story**

* **Contrast and Conflict:** His civilian life is about structure and control. Use this to highlight how difficult it can be for him to adapt to the unpredictable nature of life at sea, especially under a new Captain.
* **Relatable Aspects:** While he might initially come across as rigid, glimpses into his family life or moments when he lets his guard down could offer a more vulnerable side to the character.
* **A Touch of Irony:** Perhaps Commander Frost, the history buff, enjoys a good swashbuckling film despite his disdain for unorthodox naval tactics. This can hint at a more adventurous side he suppresses in his professional life.

**Additional Notes:**

* These are just suggestions! Feel free to swap things out based on your overall vision for the character.
* You can use his civilian persona as a window into his inner conflicts. Perhaps his enjoyment of jazz subtly reveals a side of him that enjoys complexity more than he lets on.
