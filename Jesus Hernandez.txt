**Name:** Jesus Hernandez  
**Background:**  
- Grew up in Chatsworth, CA, in a large, low-income family with strong Mexican roots.  
- Became involved with a bad crowd as a teenager due to a mix of boredom and negative influence, possibly from a cousin.  

**Turning Point:**  
- Redirected onto a better path through a significant event or intervention by his family, leaving him with mixed feelings of gratitude and a sense of indebtedness.  

* Mr. Torres, the gruff, no-nonsense shop teacher at Jesus's old high school. Everyone thinks he's a hard-ass, but he truly believes in the potential of kids often dismissed as troublemakers.
* Jesus's Connection: Jesus gets thrown into shop class as a last resort.  He expects to goof off, but Mr. Torres is surprisingly strict and demanding. 
* The Skill Awakens:  Despite his initial resistance, Jesus discovers a hidden talent for working with metal, tools, and machinery. Mr. Torres recognizes this, pushing him when others would have written him off.
* The Turning Point: This might be less dramatic â€“ no criminal dealings, but Mr. Torres becomes the one person who makes Jesus feel like he could do something with his life. This could be a crucial factor in Jesus eventually turning things around.
* Lasting Impact: Mr. Torres showed Jesus his own potential when he didn't see it himself.  This might fuel a determination to prove him right, fostering a work ethic that serves him later on.
