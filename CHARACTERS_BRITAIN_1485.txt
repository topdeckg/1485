- **Strategic Importance of Limestone:** Recognizing limestone as a crucial ingredient for cement, the Americans see its acquisition as vital for construction purposes, essential for establishing durable infrastructure or fortifications in their new 1485 setting.

1. **The Americans' Challenge:**
   - Understanding the 15th-century land ownership complexities, the Americans need a strategic approach to access Buxton's limestone, requiring them to gain George Talbot's favor or collaborate with influential figures like Henry Vernon.

   - They must navigate the era's property laws and societal norms, potentially using historical knowledge or offering innovative solutions to present-day problems Talbot or Vernon might face.

3. **Henry Vernon's Role:**
   - While not Talbot's guardian, as his uncle, Vernon could significantly influence Talbot's decisions. The Americans could engage with Vernon, leveraging his ambitions or concerns to facilitate access to the limestone.

4. **Strategic Alliances and Offerings:**
   - The goal extends beyond limestone acquisition; offering knowledge, technology, or alliances that promise security and prosperity could be key to winning Talbot's and possibly Vernon's trust and cooperation.

The Americans are aware of Buxton's significant lime industry, which becomes pivotal post the 16th century. Given the geological richness and the historical use of limestone for building and lime production, they recognize the potential of these deposits. The geological stability and quality of Buxton limestone make it an ideal resource for their needs. Their challenge lies in navigating the 15th-century landscape to harness this resource, requiring strategic engagement with local landholders like George Talbot and understanding the historical context of limestone usage and quarrying in the region.

**John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln**

Background & Family Ties

* Powerful Lineage: Nephew of Edward IV and Richard III, born into one of the most influential Yorkist families. His mother, Elizabeth of York, was sister to both kings.
* Early Titles:  Made Earl of Lincoln in 1467 at a young age, highlighting his importance to the Yorkist dynasty. 
* Education & Upbringing: likely received an education befitting his status, potentially with military training. Close proximity to his uncles would have given him firsthand exposure to court politics and warfare.

Role Under Richard III

* Key Supporter: After Edward IV's death, Lincoln sided with Richard III and was instrumental in securing his power. 
* Rewarded with Power: Appointed Lord President of the Council of the North, giving him significant authority in Northern England.  
* Designated Heir: Richard III, lacking a son, declared Lincoln his heir presumptive. This elevated Lincoln, but also made him a target for those challenging Richard's claim.

Lingering Concerns & Ambitions

* Mistrusful Nature: While he outwardly supported Richard, some historians suggest he may have harbored doubts about his uncle's actions, particularly the rumored murder of the Princes in the Tower.
* Desire for the Throne: Though designated heir, it's likely Lincoln harbored his own ambitions for the crown. This potential for disloyalty makes him a complex figure.

Relevance to the Story

* Potential Conspirator: In the summer of 1485, as the threat of Henry Tudor looms, Lincoln's position is precarious. Could he turn against his uncle and support Tudor, seeing it as a path to power?
* Connection to the North: His authority in the North could be significant if conflict arises. Does this play a role in how other characters perceive him, or could it be used for strategic advantage?
* Past Actions Matter: Did any of the characters at Macclesfield have past dealings with Lincoln? His reputation, potentially one of ruthlessness in service of Richard III, could precede him. 

How to Portray Him

* Ambiguous Figure: Don't paint him as a clear-cut villain or hero. His ambition and complex family ties should create internal conflict between potential loyalty and self-interest.
* Influenced by Circumstances: Lincoln's decisions likely hinged on the changing political landscape. Show him weighing his options, calculating the risks and rewards of supporting Tudor or staying loyal to Richard.
* Through the Eyes of Others: Use the characters' perceptions of Lincoln to reflect his reputation. Some may fear him, others may see him as a potential savior, highlighting the uncertainty of his true motivations.

Additional Considerations

* Historical Ambiguity: Historians still debate Lincoln's true intentions  and his role in subsequent plots against Henry Tudor. This gives you creative flexibility in the story.
* Research for Inspiration: Delving into accounts of Richard III's reign will offer further insights into Lincoln's potential actions and mindset.

## John de Vere

Here's a look at John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, before the summer of 1485, with an eye towards how you can leverage his history in the story:

Background & Reputation

* Powerful Lancastrian:  From a staunchly Lancastrian family with a long history of opposing the Yorkists. He suffered greatly for his loyalties.
* Imprisonment & Exile:  Imprisoned after a failed Lancastrian plot in 1462, then escaped and spent years in exile in France. 
* Skilled Commander:  Despite setbacks, he was respected for his military prowess and unwavering support for the Lancastrian cause. 

Role Under Henry VII

* Instrumental in Tudor's Victory:  His escape from imprisonment and defection to Henry Tudor were crucial in turning the tide at Bosworth.
* Rewarded with Power:  After Henry VII became king, Oxford was restored to his titles and lands, appointed Lord Great Chamberlain, and given numerous influential positions within the new regime.

Key Character Traits

* Uncompromising Loyalty:  Oxford's entire life was shaped by his commitment to the Lancastrian cause.  Expect him to be a fierce supporter of Henry Tudor, even if ruthlessly pragmatic in achieving their shared goals.
* Potential for Resentment:  While loyal, he bore the scars of past imprisonments. Could he harbor resentment towards former Yorkists, even those seeking reconciliation with the new regime?
* Distrust of Opportunists: Decades of conflict had likely made him wary of those easily changing sides. Could he be suspicious of those aligning with Henry Tudor out of convenience rather than true conviction?  

Ways to Incorporate Him in the Story

* A Force to be Reckoned With: Even if Oxford is not a central character, his presence and reputation  can influence events.  Characters might fear his retribution or see him as a protector, depending on their history.
* Connection to the Past: Oxford represents the lingering wounds of the Wars of the Roses. Any Yorkist sympathizers, or even those who simply want to move on, would view him with unease.
* The Potential for Conflict:  His loyalty is to Henry Tudor, not necessarily to individual families formerly associated with the Yorkist cause. This could bring him into conflict with characters connected to the Talbots or the Staffords.
* Macclesfield Connection?: Did Oxford or his family have any past dealings with Macclesfield's previous lords? This could create unexpected connections or past grievances. 

How to Portray Him

* Not a Gentle Idealist: Oxford is likely a hardened figure. Show his determination, but also the potential for ruthlessness born out of past struggles.
* Complex Loyalties: He's loyal to the Lancastrian cause and Henry Tudor above all else. Individual family loyalties likely take a backseat to his broader convictions. 
* Through Others' Eyes: Use how other characters, both Yorkist and Lancastrian, perceive him to reveal their own motivations and anxieties in this new era.

It's highly likely that John de Vere was with Henry Tudor in France as they gathered their army.  Here's why:

1. Key Strategist & Commander: Oxford was one of Henry Tudor's most trusted and experienced military commanders, particularly after Jasper Tudor, Henry's uncle. Oxford's knowledge of England and his military prowess would have been invaluable during the planning and recruitment phases in France.

2.  Years in Exile:  Oxford had spent years exiled in France with Henry Tudor and other Lancastrian supporters. This built not only loyalty but a sense of camaraderie forged through shared hardship and common purpose. 

3.  Leadership Role at Bosworth: Oxford commanded the vanguard of the Tudor army at the Battle of Bosworth. This prominent position wouldn't have been given to someone absent during the crucial preparatory phases.

4. Limited Records: While records of exactly who comprised Henry Tudor's inner circle in France might be scarce, Oxford's later prominence and the trust clearly placed in him strongly suggest he was present. 

However, it's worth noting:

* Other Lancastrian Exiles: Henry Tudor wasn't alone in France. Other key figures were likely involved, offering their support and resources.
* Secrecy & Strategy:  The gathering of an army would have required some level of secrecy.  Oxford might have been involved in clandestine recruitment efforts alongside Henry Tudor.

How to Use This in the Story

* Portraying Camaraderie:  If you have scenes depicting Henry Tudor and his supporters in France, including Oxford offers opportunities to show their determination, strategizing, and the long struggle that bonds them.
* Oxford's Perspective:  Perhaps offer a brief glimpse from Oxford's perspective – his hopes, potential fears, and his unwavering belief in returning to England.
* Foreshadowing his Leadership:   If appropriate, subtly depict Oxford's strategic mind and military knowledge, foreshadowing his key role in the coming battle. 

Remember, even if you don't include scenes in France, Oxford's established presence at Henry Tudor's side when they land in England highlights his pivotal importance to the Tudor cause.
