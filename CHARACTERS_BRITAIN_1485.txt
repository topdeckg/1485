**Rhys ap Thomas**

* Powerful Welsh nobleman:  Held significant influence in South Wales under Richard III.
* Decisive Supporter of Henry Tudor:  His switch of allegiance played a key role at the Battle of Bosworth Field.
* Rewarded and Loyal:  After Bosworth, Tudor showered him with titles and positions. But,  historical records hint at Rhys' shrewdness and awareness that his power was tied to the success of the Tudor dynasty.

**Rhys in the Narrative: Building on the Potential**

* **Contact for the Americans:** Research is spot on. Rhys' influence in the region, combined with his potential for pragmatism, makes him a logical contact point for them.
* **The Price of Loyalty:**  Rhys likely won't offer aid out of pure idealism. He'll want something in return.
    * Not Just Land: Could the Americans offer him something else? Access to trade routes, knowledge of new technologies, or a promise of increased regional authority? 
    * The Risk Factor: Does he truly believe in Henry Tudor's cause, or is this pure opportunism? There's a chance of failure, which has to play into his calculations.
* **The "Test"**: Rhys won't act blindly. He'll likely want to assess the Americans, gauge their resources and determination. Could this involve him setting them a task to prove their commitment?
* **Local Influence:** Don't just paint Rhys as the end goal for the Americans. Who needs to be swayed around him? Are there lesser nobles he'll need to bring on board to bolster support? 

**How to Portray Rhys in the Story**

* **Shrewd, Not Villainous:** He's ambitious and calculating, but this doesn't make him inherently treacherous. This period was about shifting alliances and survival.
* **Charismatic Leader:**  He has to be able to inspire people to follow him and potentially switch sides.  Is he charmingly persuasive, or a more intimidating, imposing figure?
* **Hints of the Future:** Without spoiling Rhys' eventual support of Henry Tudor, you can foreshadow his decisiveness and awareness of changing political winds

## Wingfield Manor

**Henry Vernon**

* Position: Powerful Derbyshire landowner and esquire of the body to Richard III.
* Reputation: Records on him are a bit thin, but his closeness to Richard III suggests he was loyal, potentially fighting at Bosworth for the Yorkist side.
* Likely Motivation: Maintaining his position and lands would be paramount. He'd need to tread carefully, as the new Tudor regime would seek out Richard III loyalists.
* Ward to Young Talbot: This is crucial! It places him in a complex position – responsible for the son of a powerful family, yet potentially vulnerable due to his own past allegiances.  

**George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury**

* Young & Vulnerable:  At about 15 years old in 1485, he's legally a minor even as a titled Earl. This makes him susceptible to manipulation by those trying to gain control of his lands and influence.
* Family Ties: 
    * His late father's execution likely made him a figure of suspicion for Henry Tudor.
    * His marriage to Anne Hastings, another potential target of the new regime, further complicates his position.
* Potential Pawn: He represents significant power, making him a potential target for anyone looking to strengthen their own position with  Henry Tudor.  Could others seek to displace Henry Vernon as his guardian?  

**Incorporating Them in the Story**

* Vernon's Dilemma: This is ripe for exploration! His ward's very existence jeopardizes his own standing. Does he:
    * Protect George fiercely out of loyalty or a sense of duty?
    * See George as a path to his own redemption in the eyes of Henry Tudor?
    * Secretly work to undermine George so he can step into a more powerful role himself?
* Talbot's Eyes:  Use George as a witness to intrigue at Macclesfield or the surrounding region. He's young, perhaps naively trustful, offering a lens into the maneuvering of adults around him.
* Unexpected Connection: Could a character at Macclesfield be distantly related to the Talbots or Vernons?  This creates a thread linking them to the wider power struggles.
* The Hastings Connection:  George's wife, Anne, offers a way to build tension. Will the downfall of her family cause additional problems for George? 

The relationships between the Talbot, Hastings, and Stafford families are a perfect tangle of political ambition, past betrayals, and complicated family ties – all ripe for inclusion in the historical fiction! Here's how to weave this web into the plot:

1.  Echoes of the Past

* The Stafford Execution:  This casts a long shadow. Henry Stafford's death on the orders of Richard III still has repercussions in 1485.
    * Lingering mistrust:  Henry Tudor, even if victorious, may never fully trust those who once served the Yorkist regime, making the Talbots vulnerable.
    * Seekers of Revenge:   Did the Staffords have allies? Could someone seek to undermine the Talbots subtly, blaming them by association for Henry Stafford's fate?
* Past Support: During the Wars of the Roses, these families likely shifted allegiances for survival. Old betrayals, even if mended on the surface, would still create tension.

2. Intertwined Ties

* Young George Talbot: He is both an Earl and the nephew of the executed Henry Stafford. 
    * Guilt by Association: Some might hold him responsible for his uncle's actions, unfairly targeting him to gain leverage.  
    * Sympathy: Others might see him as an innocent victim of a ruthless regime, offering a chance to gain favor with the Talbots *and* distance themselves from the Yorkists.
* Anne Hastings:  George's wife, the daughter of the executed William Hastings. 
    * A Vulnerable Heiress: Her family's downfall might prompt suitors seeking her hand and, by extension, control over her potential inheritance.
    * Connection to the Staffords: Was her marriage to George Talbot arranged to mend old wounds between the families? If so, is this a genuine alliance or a fragile arrangement easily broken for personal gain? 

3. Using This in the Story

* Manipulation of the Young:  Both George and Anne are potential pawns in the political games of adults. Show schemers whispering doubts and offering seemingly tempting alternatives.
* Macclesfield Connection: Did Catherine Stafford have past dealings with the Hastings family? Could this spark an unexpected alliance, or resentment based on past perceived slights?
* Unexpected Benefactor: Introduce a minor character, a distant relative or someone with past ties to one of these families. They take an interest in protecting George or Anne, driven by old loyalty, hidden motives, or simple sympathy.
* The Threat of Rumors:  Even unsubstantiated gossip can be dangerous. Have characters hear whispers about the Talbots being secretly disloyal, or the true motive behind Anne's marriage. This forces reactions and reveals loyalties.

**Buxton Limestone**

1. The Americans' Dilemma

* Knowledge of Future: They know the potential value of this limestone deposit, but  accessing it requires gaining Talbot's  favor – not an easy feat given they're foreigners with no prior connection.
* Historical Limitations: Land ownership in 1485 is convoluted, with complicated inheritance laws. They can't just buy the land or offer Talbot modern-day riches he wouldn't comprehend.
* Need for a Proxy: They might need to find an intermediary, someone trusted by Talbot or Henry Vernon, whom they can manipulate and use as a go-between. 

2. Talbot as the Key

* George's Vulnerability: Use his young age and potential for manipulation. The Americans would likely start with subtle approaches, offering gifts or hinting at vague  "advantages" to gain his attention.
* Vernon as Obstacle or Opportunity: Henry Vernon holds the reins as Talbot's guardian. Can they sway Vernon with promises of greater power or wealth under the new regime? Could he be suspicious of their motives, becoming a potential antagonist?
* Beyond the Land:  It's not only about limestone. Is there something else the Americans can offer Talbot? Access to future knowledge that could ensure his family's prosperity, or perhaps a connection to Henry Tudor that would bolster their position in this uncertain time?

3. Narrative Potential

* The Slow Burn Approach:  Winning Talbot's trust shouldn't be easy. This creates a long-term project for the Americans, full of risks as they tiptoe around historical protocols.
* Unexpected Obstacles:  Other players might also become aware of the land's potential value. Could a local lord or rival of Vernon's try to gain control over George Talbot?
* Conflict Within the Group: Might the Americans disagree on their approach?  Some may want a quick solution,  while others may advocate patience and building a genuine relationship.
* Talbot's Awakening:  Don't make George a passive pawn. As he matures, he could become more aware of his land's importance and his own power to negotiate, adding a new layer of complication.

Things to Consider

* How Much Do the Americans Know?  Do they have a precise understanding of the limestone deposit? If it's more of a hunch, they may need to find discreet ways to investigate the land.
* Research is the Friend:  Delving into 15th-century mining and land rights will make their scheming more believable and add rich historical detail. 

Let's Plot!  

* Do the Americans make their initial approach to Talbot or Vernon first? 
* Are there potential allies or informants  around the young earl whom the Americans could utilize?  
* What kind of "gift" could pique young George Talbot's  interest without being overly suspicious?

**John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln**

Background & Family Ties

* Powerful Lineage: Nephew of Edward IV and Richard III, born into one of the most influential Yorkist families. His mother, Elizabeth of York, was sister to both kings.
* Early Titles:  Made Earl of Lincoln in 1467 at a young age, highlighting his importance to the Yorkist dynasty. 
* Education & Upbringing: likely received an education befitting his status, potentially with military training. Close proximity to his uncles would have given him firsthand exposure to court politics and warfare.

Role Under Richard III

* Key Supporter: After Edward IV's death, Lincoln sided with Richard III and was instrumental in securing his power. 
* Rewarded with Power: Appointed Lord President of the Council of the North, giving him significant authority in Northern England.  
* Designated Heir: Richard III, lacking a son, declared Lincoln his heir presumptive. This elevated Lincoln, but also made him a target for those challenging Richard's claim.

Lingering Concerns & Ambitions

* Mistrusful Nature: While he outwardly supported Richard, some historians suggest he may have harbored doubts about his uncle's actions, particularly the rumored murder of the Princes in the Tower.
* Desire for the Throne: Though designated heir, it's likely Lincoln harbored his own ambitions for the crown. This potential for disloyalty makes him a complex figure.

Relevance to the Story

* Potential Conspirator: In the summer of 1485, as the threat of Henry Tudor looms, Lincoln's position is precarious. Could he turn against his uncle and support Tudor, seeing it as a path to power?
* Connection to the North: His authority in the North could be significant if conflict arises. Does this play a role in how other characters perceive him, or could it be used for strategic advantage?
* Past Actions Matter: Did any of the characters at Macclesfield have past dealings with Lincoln? His reputation, potentially one of ruthlessness in service of Richard III, could precede him. 

How to Portray Him

* Ambiguous Figure: Don't paint him as a clear-cut villain or hero. His ambition and complex family ties should create internal conflict between potential loyalty and self-interest.
* Influenced by Circumstances: Lincoln's decisions likely hinged on the changing political landscape. Show him weighing his options, calculating the risks and rewards of supporting Tudor or staying loyal to Richard.
* Through the Eyes of Others: Use the characters' perceptions of Lincoln to reflect his reputation. Some may fear him, others may see him as a potential savior, highlighting the uncertainty of his true motivations.

Additional Considerations

* Historical Ambiguity: Historians still debate Lincoln's true intentions  and his role in subsequent plots against Henry Tudor. This gives you creative flexibility in the story.
* Research for Inspiration: Delving into accounts of Richard III's reign will offer further insights into Lincoln's potential actions and mindset.

Here's a look at John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, before the summer of 1485, with an eye towards how you can leverage his history in the story:

Background & Reputation

* Powerful Lancastrian:  From a staunchly Lancastrian family with a long history of opposing the Yorkists. He suffered greatly for his loyalties.
* Imprisonment & Exile:  Imprisoned after a failed Lancastrian plot in 1462, then escaped and spent years in exile in France. 
* Skilled Commander:  Despite setbacks, he was respected for his military prowess and unwavering support for the Lancastrian cause. 

Role Under Henry VII

* Instrumental in Tudor's Victory:  His escape from imprisonment and defection to Henry Tudor were crucial in turning the tide at Bosworth.
* Rewarded with Power:  After Henry VII became king, Oxford was restored to his titles and lands, appointed Lord Great Chamberlain, and given numerous influential positions within the new regime.

Key Character Traits

* Uncompromising Loyalty:  Oxford's entire life was shaped by his commitment to the Lancastrian cause.  Expect him to be a fierce supporter of Henry Tudor, even if ruthlessly pragmatic in achieving their shared goals.
* Potential for Resentment:  While loyal, he bore the scars of past imprisonments. Could he harbor resentment towards former Yorkists, even those seeking reconciliation with the new regime?
* Distrust of Opportunists: Decades of conflict had likely made him wary of those easily changing sides. Could he be suspicious of those aligning with Henry Tudor out of convenience rather than true conviction?  

Ways to Incorporate Him in the Story

* A Force to be Reckoned With: Even if Oxford is not a central character, his presence and reputation  can influence events.  Characters might fear his retribution or see him as a protector, depending on their history.
* Connection to the Past: Oxford represents the lingering wounds of the Wars of the Roses. Any Yorkist sympathizers, or even those who simply want to move on, would view him with unease.
* The Potential for Conflict:  His loyalty is to Henry Tudor, not necessarily to individual families formerly associated with the Yorkist cause. This could bring him into conflict with characters connected to the Talbots or the Staffords.
* Macclesfield Connection?: Did Oxford or his family have any past dealings with Macclesfield's previous lords? This could create unexpected connections or past grievances. 

How to Portray Him

* Not a Gentle Idealist: Oxford is likely a hardened figure. Show his determination, but also the potential for ruthlessness born out of past struggles.
* Complex Loyalties: He's loyal to the Lancastrian cause and Henry Tudor above all else. Individual family loyalties likely take a backseat to his broader convictions. 
* Through Others' Eyes: Use how other characters, both Yorkist and Lancastrian, perceive him to reveal their own motivations and anxieties in this new era.

It's highly likely that John de Vere was with Henry Tudor in France as they gathered their army.  Here's why:

1. Key Strategist & Commander: Oxford was one of Henry Tudor's most trusted and experienced military commanders, particularly after Jasper Tudor, Henry's uncle. Oxford's knowledge of England and his military prowess would have been invaluable during the planning and recruitment phases in France.

2.  Years in Exile:  Oxford had spent years exiled in France with Henry Tudor and other Lancastrian supporters. This built not only loyalty but a sense of camaraderie forged through shared hardship and common purpose. 

3.  Leadership Role at Bosworth: Oxford commanded the vanguard of the Tudor army at the Battle of Bosworth. This prominent position wouldn't have been given to someone absent during the crucial preparatory phases.

4. Limited Records: While records of exactly who comprised Henry Tudor's inner circle in France might be scarce, Oxford's later prominence and the trust clearly placed in him strongly suggest he was present. 

However, it's worth noting:

* Other Lancastrian Exiles: Henry Tudor wasn't alone in France. Other key figures were likely involved, offering their support and resources.
* Secrecy & Strategy:  The gathering of an army would have required some level of secrecy.  Oxford might have been involved in clandestine recruitment efforts alongside Henry Tudor.

How to Use This in the Story

* Portraying Camaraderie:  If you have scenes depicting Henry Tudor and his supporters in France, including Oxford offers opportunities to show their determination, strategizing, and the long struggle that bonds them.
* Oxford's Perspective:  Perhaps offer a brief glimpse from Oxford's perspective – his hopes, potential fears, and his unwavering belief in returning to England.
* Foreshadowing his Leadership:   If appropriate, subtly depict Oxford's strategic mind and military knowledge, foreshadowing his key role in the coming battle. 

Remember, even if you don't include scenes in France, Oxford's established presence at Henry Tudor's side when they land in England highlights his pivotal importance to the Tudor cause.
