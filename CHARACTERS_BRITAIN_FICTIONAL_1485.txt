### Fictional characters from the British Isles and western Europe in 1485

## John Rumbly
* Born 1471
* The son of John Rumbly and Eleanor Raince
* 14 years old
* Training in archery, as required by law
* John Rumbly Sr. is an itinerant woodworker, traveling with his family in search of work and materials when there is no work in Macclesfield.

`The Cheshire archers were a body of elite soldiers noted for their skills with the longbow that fought in many engagements in England and France in the Middle Ages. Battles at which there were sizeable numbers of Cheshire archers include Agincourt and Crecy. Richard II employed a bodyguard of these yeoman archers who came from the Macclesfield Hundred and the forest districts of Cheshire.`

Young Rumbly was out early on the morning on July 2, 1485. His mother had given him a scrap of burlap, which he used to bundle the foraged plants his family needed to survive. He'd already collected a pile of nettles and had his eye on a field of dandelions, the buds not yet flowered.

**Background:**

* Born into a family of modest means in the town of Macclesfield, Cheshire.
* Due to his father's itinerant work, John's childhood is marked by frequent travel and a deep familiarity with the countryside.
* As a young man of his era, John is legally required to train in archery, developing a rudimentary skill with the longbow.
* Survival Skills: John is adept at identifying and foraging edible plants, a crucial skill that supplements his family's meager resources.  

**Fateful Encounter: July 2, 1485**

* Location:  While foraging on the edge of Macclesfield Forest, John is caught in the unknown event that transports the USS Alliance.
* Injuries: He suffers severe burns and falls unconscious, a combination of the event's effects and his existing malnutrition.
* Discovery: Members of the Alliance crew stumble upon his body. Mistaking him for Belle Rive resident, they transport him back to their ship for urgent medical attention.

**John as a Catalyst:**

* The Rosetta Stone: John's initial confusion and his archaic Middle English (and that of a rural uneducated commoner) become the first real clue to the crew that they are not simply in an unfamiliar location, but a different time period entirely. His language is the key that unlocks the mystery of their displacement.
* Bridge & Barrier: While John can provide some context for the world they find themselves in, the vast linguistic gap creates a significant obstacle. Communication is fractured and difficult, highlighting the crew's isolation in 1485.

**The Emergence of "Miracles":**

* Accidental Medicine: The crew's advanced medical care, even basic treatments, seem like miracles to John. When he returns to Macclesfield, bearing not just the scars of his experience but also significantly improved health, he becomes a living legend.
* Desperation & Hope:  News of John's "healing" spreads through the region.  This presents the crew with a stark choice: do they risk further exposure by intervening in the lives of locals, potentially altering history, or do they refuse aid and shatter the image of miraculous power that's been inadvertently created?

## Thomas Reed

As a tanner, Thomas Reed operates his tannery to the northwest of Macclesfield, strategically placed downwind to spare the villagers from the pungent odors characteristic of his trade. His expertise in transforming animal hides into durable leather is crucial for the community, supplying materials for a variety of uses, from clothing to essential gear.

Reed's home is adjacent to his workplace, where he resides with his wife and three children. Their domestic life is intertwined with the rhythms of the tannery, where the children are accustomed to the processes of curing, soaking, and dyeing leather.

The eldest child, Gilbert, while immersed in the world of tanning through his father's trade, is captivated by the artistry and versatility of leatherworking. Recognizing the distinction between his father's role in preparing hides and the skilled craft of transforming leather into functional and decorative items, Gilbert aspires to extend his family's legacy into this refined trade.

Despite his father's expertise in tanning — a crucial first step in the leather production process — Gilbert understands that mastering leatherworking requires guidance beyond what his home environment can provide. Thus, he sets his sights on securing an apprenticeship with a master leatherworker, aiming to bridge the gap between raw material and finished product.

Reed, aware of his son's ambitions, supports Gilbert's desire to broaden his skills. The family's connections, established through Reed's supply of tanned leather to artisans across Cheshire and Derbyshire, become instrumental in Gilbert's quest. Reed leverages these relationships, proposing trades or exchanges that could facilitate an apprenticeship opportunity for Gilbert, demonstrating a father's commitment to his child's aspirations.

Gilbert's potential apprenticeship not only signifies his personal growth but also symbolizes the interdependence of trades within the community. His journey from a tanner's household to a leatherworking workshop embodies the collaborative spirit of the time, where various crafts and skills converge to sustain the local economy and enrich the cultural tapestry of the region.

The Reed family capitalizes on the seclusion afforded by their tannery's location, an area less coveted due to the odorous nature of their trade. This isolation provides them with ample land to maintain a modest homestead where they raise hogs and chickens. These animals play a dual role in the Reed household: they are a source of sustenance and contribute to the tannery's operations. The hogs, in particular, are valuable not just for their meat but also for their skins, which are processed into tough, resilient leather at the tannery.

Thomas Reed, while a skilled tanner, does not specialize in the fine art of leatherworking. As a result, his own pigskin boots, crafted from the leather he produces, are purely utilitarian. They are sturdy and functional, embodying the essence of his work, yet they lack the refined comfort and fit that a professional leatherworker might achieve. These boots, somewhat chafing and unpolished, serve as a humble testament to Reed's practical approach to his craft, emphasizing utility over elegance.

In this way, the Reed family's lifestyle and Thomas's own attire reflect their pragmatic adaptation to their environment and circumstances, demonstrating how their daily lives are interwoven with the rhythm of their tannery and the broader community's needs.
