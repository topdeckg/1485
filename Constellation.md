# Novel Primer: "1485: Constellation"

**Concept:** A Ring of Fire event transports the USS Constellation, a cutting-edge frigate, along with its crew and civilian observers, to the year 1485, into a forest near Macclesfield. The novel explores their struggle to adapt, lead, and survive in a dramatically different era.

## **Key Elements:**

- **Setting:** Initially set in Marinette, Wisconsin, during the maiden voyage of the USS Constellation. A Ring of Fire event shifts a 100k square meter area, including the ship, part of the shipyard, and bystanders, to 1485 England, forming a small lake in a dense forest.

## **Main Characters:**

### **Captain Ulysses Middleton:** Accidental leader, commanding the USS Constellation, thrust into the role amid personal and professional turmoil.

### The Path to Captaincy

#### Unforeseen Circumstances
- **Scandal:** The first selected candidate for captaincy was implicated in a high-profile scandal involving the misuse of naval resources, leading to a dishonorable discharge.
- **Disease:** The second in line succumbed to a rare and sudden illness that left them incapacitated, unable to assume command responsibilities.
- **Untimely Promotion:** The third candidate, seen as a perfect fit for the role, was unexpectedly promoted to a higher position within the Navy due to an urgent need for experienced leadership in a strategic command role, removing them from consideration.
- **Accidental Heroism:** Just weeks before the final selection, Middleton was involved in a critical incident where his quick thinking and leadership averted a potential disaster during a routine exercise. This act of heroism, though not widely publicized, caught the attention of the selection committee.

##### The Decision
- Faced with dwindling options and time constraints, the selection committee reviewed Middleton's record and recent heroics. Despite his recent promotion to commander and relative inexperience at that rank, his actions demonstrated the qualities of leadership and decisiveness they desperately needed. Coupled with his technical proficiency and understanding of the Constellation’s advanced systems, Middleton emerged as an unexpected but fitting choice for captain.

#### Legacy Twist: Admiral Elijah Middleton

- **Respected Career:** Ulysses Middleton's late grandfather, Admiral Elijah Middleton, served with distinction from 1976 to 1989. He was known for his strategic acumen, leadership in critical naval engagements, and contributions to naval training programs.
- **Influence and Expectations:** Admiral Middleton’s legacy is a double-edged sword for Ulysses. On one hand, it opens doors and commands a certain respect; on the other, it sets high expectations and casts a long shadow over Ulysses’ career. Ulysses has always felt the pressure to live up to his grandfather’s legacy but desires to make a name for himself on his own terms.
- **Mentorship and Philosophy:** Through stories passed down from his grandfather, Ulysses inherited a philosophy of leadership that values the welfare of the crew above all, strategic thinking, and moral integrity. These principles become his guiding light as he navigates the challenges of his unexpected command.

#### Integration into the Narrative

- **Character Development:** Ulysses struggles with the weight of his rapid ascension and the legacy he carries. His development from a reluctant leader to a confident captain mirrors his internal journey to step out of his grandfather’s shadow.
- **Plot Dynamics:** The circumstances of Middleton’s promotion and his grandfather’s legacy can be leveraged to create tension and conflict within the story. His decisions and leadership style are scrutinized through the lens of his legacy, affecting relationships with his crew, especially with Commander Joshua Frost, and shaping interactions with historical figures they encounter in 1485.
- **Thematic Depth:** These elements enrich the novel’s exploration of themes such as the burden of legacy, the making of a leader, and the quest for personal identity against the backdrop of historical expectations and familial reputation.


### **Commander Joshua Frost:** The executive officer (XO), who is reluctant and skeptical of Middleton's leadership but crucial to the crew's survival.

#### Frost's Background and Ambitions

- **Investigation and Clearance:** Frost was thoroughly investigated and ultimately cleared in the scandal involving Captain Devlin's misuse of naval resources. Despite his exoneration, the incident left a mark on his career, making the prospect of commanding the USS Constellation a chance for redemption and proof of his unblemished competence.
- **Expectations Thwarted:** Having served as XO under Captain Devlin and having been cleared of any wrongdoing, Frost believed he was the natural successor to command the Constellation. His anticipation turned to disbelief and resentment when Middleton, a less experienced officer, was appointed captain.

#### Frost's Plans and the Annapolis Position

- **An Escape Route:** Disappointed and feeling overlooked, Frost secures a position as an instructor at Annapolis, viewing it as both an escape from a situation he sees as a slight against his qualifications and a chance to rebuild his reputation in a prestigious setting.
- **Hidden Intentions:** Frost keeps his arrangements for Annapolis a secret, planning to announce his departure only after the successful delivery of the Constellation to its home port in Washington. This decision influences his interactions with the crew and Middleton, as he balances his duties with his plans to leave.

#### Integrating Frost's Arc into the Novel

- **Interpersonal Dynamics:** The tension between Frost and Middleton can serve as a central element of the novel's interpersonal drama. Frost's internal conflict—his professional respect for Middleton's capabilities versus his personal resentment and thwarted ambition—adds depth to his character.
- **Professional Dilemma:** Frost's commitment to his role as XO and his desire to leave for Annapolis create a professional dilemma, especially as the unexpected journey to 1485 tests his loyalties and priorities.
- **Character Growth:** Frost's arc can explore themes of ambition, redemption, and the definition of personal success. His experiences through the novel, particularly the crisis of being transported to 1485, may lead him to reassess his values and decisions.
- **Narrative Conflict:** The revelation of Frost's plans to depart for Annapolis can come at a critical moment in the story, challenging the crew's cohesion and Middleton's leadership. It could serve as a turning point for Frost, who must decide where his true loyalties lie.
